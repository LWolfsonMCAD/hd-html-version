	<section class="featured">
	<!-- The content in this area will be changing regularly.
	It will include a featured image (use either "Hero Image" custom field 
	or the "featured image"/thumbnail in WP), a title, and text area. 
	It needs to be easy to update it, and the content may be pulled at a 
	later date to other pages. -->
