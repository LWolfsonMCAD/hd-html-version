		<p>Jackie hails from the great, warm state of Minnesota. She graduated  from the University of Minnesota with a Journalism degree, and there she performed in shows such as A Lesson in Dead Language, and the world premier of Working. She also studied acting at The Betty Ann Norton Theater School in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

		<p>To date, her favorite shows have been Mr. Marmalade (Bradley), Nunsense II: The Second Coming (Mother Superior) and The Glass Menagerie (Amanda Wingfield). An original member of High Dramma, and company manager, Jackie hopes to continue writing and acting with the group until 2012, when the world’s supposed to end. And, if it doesn’t end, well, that will just be awkward for everyone.</p>
